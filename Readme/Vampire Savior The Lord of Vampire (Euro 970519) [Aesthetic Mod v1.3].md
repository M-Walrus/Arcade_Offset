Vampire Savior The Lord of Vampire Euro 970519 Aesthetic Mod v1.3 by VMP_KyleW:

        [Details]

I'm an enthused VSAV player who is often finding new ways to be engaged in the game & it's competitive community. You can reach me on twitter - @VMP_KyleW 

Version: (1.2) Issued for public use, functional on every known device.

Update
December 26th, 2020, V1.2
Fetus of God's stage/camera extents are now equal to every other stage in the game. Fetus of God has been added as a playable stage within the player-1 vs player-2 stage select chance tables. Now all stages have a 12/16 chance of being selected while stages associated to the selected characters have an additional 4/16 chance. Every stage, including Iron Horse Iron Terror & Fetus of God, is now available in every match while also having character's home stages maintain a higher probablility. Jedah's home stage is weighted towards Fetus of God.

December 4th, 2020, V1.1
In player-1 versus player-2 mode, stage selection is no longer solely weighted by character selection. Now all stages have a 11/16 chance of being selected while stages associated to the selected characters have an additional 5/16 chance of being selected. Every stage, including Iron Horse Iron Terror, is now available in every match while also having character's home stages maintain a higher probablility.
Each modification provides the decrypted address & data type for reference.

Goal
The goal of this mod adheres to two principles. First and most importantly, I am making a deliberate effort to not alter gameplay, such that this mod could be considered for use in the competitive VSAV Scene. Secondly, I am altering the accessibility of most secret content. This includes changing access conditions to secret character colors, stage colors & numerous rare animations. I did not alter conditions that were already accessible at a 50% probability rate. By undertaking this project, the need to quantify & document all of these rare occurrences arised. VSAV community members collaborated on a Discord channel. The results of everyone's hard work can be found on a new wiki page labeled VSAV Secrets. Users should reference this wiki page for a full list of Secrets and unlock conditions within VSAV. While changing access conditions for all of the rare animations, there are numerous ones that were not achievable, due to factors like, how that individual animation was programmed (Anakaris's alternate intro) or how interconnected the animation is to story mode functions (Jedah's alternate intro).

Package Overview:
This (.zip) file contains every file needed to play an encrypted EU rom set. However, only (3) files are unique.
vsav(.key) is the standard encryption key, used to play encrypted roms.
vm3e(.03d) & vm3(.10b) are the only files that I directly modified. This is where conditions for secrets were changed. There was not enough room to add new conditions during the character select input assessment functions, so I had to jump to the free space at the very end of the OpCode and provide the entire function (including my modifications for specific inputs) there. This is why the second (.10b) file is needed.

Thank You to the many people who inspired, consulted & tested along the way: Jais, 9T9/Keough, Alphakami/Tad, Felineki, NBee, Moebius, Viper Snake, Rotanibor, @SF2Platinum, JedPossum, ChooseGoose, Typhas, Ken, Ego, Zero-One

        [Function]

Aesthetic Modification Details are provided below:
_________________________________________________

Alternate Title Screen (0x10D2, OpCode)

This romset defaults to Coine Mode as Free Play, but users may choose to change the Coin Mode, within Service menu 7-1, to another value. If that is done, add a coin without pressing Player-1 or Player-2 START and the alternate
title screen will be displayed. Be mindful that an emulator will generate a separate file for managing these temporary menus settings, designed to be writted to the EPROM. If you want to remove the temporary file and go back to
the romset defaults, delete (VSAV.NV) within your emulator directory.

Service Menu Settings
I altered three default Euro settings in the Service Menu to align with our tournament standards
Coin Mode = Free Play (No Coins Needed) (0x2456, Data Table)
Regulation = OFF (Blood is on) (0x245C, Data Table)
Game Speed = Turbo 3 (0x2469, Data Table)

Match Demos
I changed the (8) demo matches to show unique characters & new match-ups. Some examples are
Dark Gallon vs Oboro (0x5C08, OpCode)
Demitri vs Demitri (0x5C0C, OpCode)
Anakaris vs Victor(0x5C10, OpCode)
Gallon vs Dark Gallon (0x5C14, OpCode)
Sasquatch vs Sasquatch (0x5C18, OpCode)
Dark Force Zabel vs Dark Force Zabel (They do not attack, this is just for laughs)(0x5C1C, OpCode)
Victor vs Oboro (0x5C20, OpCode)
Lei-Lei vs Jedah (0x5C24, OpCode)

Stage Variants (0x92C2, OpCode)
PL-1 or PL-2 can hold START just before the match loads to enable the boss version of a stage.

Stage Selection (0xC468, Data Table)
All stages have an 12/16 chance of being selected while stages associated to the selected characters have an additional 4/16 chance

Title Version Screen (Splash Page) (0x1C93D, ASCII)
Replaced the title Vampire Savior w/ the text "VSAV AESTHETIC", so users are aware this is not the original rom set. I left "970519EURO" so players know which version was altered. Added my name too.

Fetus of God camera/stage extents (0x1F27C, OpCode)
Starting at this address, values are now equal to 0x01000280. This sets the left & right boundaries equal to every other stage in the game.

Special Character Colors (0x20B38, OpCode moved into the empty space within file #10)
Select any Character with LP+LK or MP+MK to access their Auto-Guard only colors. If two players choose the same character and the same special color, one player will be forced as their default color.

Rankings
I updated the Rankings to represent select Major VSAV tournaments & Japanese Arcades, with the associated character portrait referencing the Tournament Organizor or a prominant player. I wish there were more room to add other references like Apocalypse of Darkstalkers (Chrono Zabel) or BigOne2nd (Nakanishi/OKKB/Nishiken).

Score Rankings (Tournaments)
MWC Felicia - Makai World Cup showing Ailerus Felicia (0x218E4, ASCII)
